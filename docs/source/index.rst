Introduction
============

This document describes the Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY) model :cite:`Terink2015`. The Spatial Processes in HYdrology (SPHY) model is a hydrological modeling tool suitable for a wide range of 
water resource management applications. SPHY is a state-of-the-art, easy to use, robust tool, that can be 
applied for operational as well as strategic decision support. The SPHY model has been applied and tested in various studies ranging 
from real-time soil moisture predictions in flat lands, to operational reservoir inflow forecasting applications in mountainous catchments, 
irrigation scenarios in the Nile Basin, and detailed climate change impact studies in the snow- and glacier-melt dominated the Himalayan region. Example applications can be
found :ref:`here <applications>`.

Documentation
=============

The theory and concepts of SPHY model version 2.0.0 :cite:`Terink2015` are published in the peer-reviewed journal `Geoscientific Model Development <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/2009/2015/>`_.
A link to the pdf of the article can be found `here <https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/2009/2015/gmd-8-2009-2015.pdf>`_.

Differences between version 2.0.0 and later releases are described in the :ref:`Releases Section <releases>`.
