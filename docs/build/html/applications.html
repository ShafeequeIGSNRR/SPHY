<h3>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many studies suggest that high-density rain gauge networks are required to capture the rainfall heterogeneities necessary to
accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle. However, equipping and maintaining a high-density rain gauge network
will also involve high costs. Although many studies provided useful insights on the required accuracy of rainfall estimates to accurately
describe the components of the hydrological cycle, most of these studies focused on streamflow simulations, large river basins or urban
environments.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in areal rainfall, estimated at several
spatial resolutions, on hydrological simulations of a small 6.5 km<sup>2</sup> rural lowland catchment. For this study, the SPHY model was forced with
rainfall retrieved from an X-band radar (<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-radar-image-joh"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2</span></a>) and various synthetic rainfall products, calculated using bootstrap samples of a varying number of
radar pixels, treated as virtual rain gauge locations within the catchment. This allowed us to determine the most appropriate resolution
of rainfall data to accurately describe the hydrology of a small rural lowland catchment.</p>

Right: Example of an aggregated hourly X-band radar image with rain intensity in mm h<sup>−1</sup> at a 250 m resolution square grid.</span></p>
</div>
<p>We found that the use of one rain gauge to estimate the catchment’s areal rainfall may lead to a potential error of more than six times the average
hourly rainfall. This may lead to uncertainties in simulated discharge that approach 60% of the average hourly discharge. More than 40 rain gauges
are required to reduce the potential error in areal rainfall estimation to values &lt;0.1 mm h<sup>−1</sup>. The associated uncertainty in discharge simulations
is 20% if 10 rain gauges are used, and 10% if 40 rain gauges are used. The simulation of soil moisture contents and evapotranspiration rates are
hardly affected by the number of rain gauges used to estimate the areal rainfall, which is due to the high saturated hydraulic conductivities of
the top-soil. At least 12 gauges per km<sup>2</sup> are required to capture the spatial rainfall variation that is present in radar rainfall estimates.
Analysis of an individual 18-h rainfall event revealed that the uncertainty in peak areal rainfall estimated using one rain gauge may range between
−100% and 600%. The associated uncertainty in simulated discharge for this event ranges between −67 and 233%. With 25 rain gauges the uncertainty
in simulated discharge is still in the range of −17 to 33%.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As SPHY produces spatial outputs for the soil moisture content in the root zone and the
potential and actual evapotranspiration (ET), it is a useful tool for application in agricultural
water management decision support. By facilitating easy integration of remote sensing data,
crop growth stages can be spatially assessed at different moments in time. The SPHY dynamic
vegetation module ensures that all relevant soil water fluxes correspond to crop development
stages throughout the growing season. Spatially distributed maps of root water content and ET
deficit can be produced, enabling both the identification of locations where irrigation is required
and a quantitative assessment of crop water stress. SPHY has been applied with the purpose of
providing field-specific irrigation advice for a largescale farm in western Romania, comprising
380 individual fields and approximately ten different crops.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="methodology">
<h3>Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A high spatial resolution is very relevant for supporting decisions on variable-rate irrigation. The model has therefore been
set up using a 30 m resolution, covering the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons on a daily time-step. Optical
satellite data from Landsat 8 <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#usgs2013" id="id3">[41]</a> were used as input to the dynamic vegetation module. Soil properties
were derived from the Harmonized World Soil Database <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#batjes2012" id="id4">[2]</a>, which for Romania contains data
from the Soil Geographical Database for Europe <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lambert2003" id="id5">[21]</a>. Using the Van Genuchten equation <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#vangenuchten1980" id="id6">[44]</a>,
soil saturated water content, field capacity, and wilting point were determined for the
HWSD classes occurring at the study site. Elevation data was obtained from the EU-DEM data set <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#eea2014" id="id7">[6]</a>, and
air temperature was measured by two on-farm weather stations.</p>
<p>For calibration purposes, field measurements of soil moisture and/or actual ET are desired. In
this case study, one capacitance soil moisture sensor was installed in a soybean field to monitor
root-zone water content shortly after 1 May 2014, which is the start of the soybean growing
season. The sensor measures volumetric moisture content for every 10 cm of the soil profile up
to a depth of 60 cm. It is also equipped with a rain gauge measuring the sum of rainfall and
applied irrigation water, which was used as an input to SPHY. Soil moisture measured over the
extent covered by the crop root depth was averaged and compared to simulated values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h3>Results<a class="headerlink" href="#results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In irrigation management applications like these, a model should be capable of simulating the
moisture stress experienced by the crop due to insufficient soil moisture contents, which
manifests itself by an evapotranspiration deficit (potential ET−actual ET&gt;0). <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-romania-et-deficit"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 4</span></a> shows the
spatial distribution of ET deficit, as simulated by the SPHY model for the entire farm on
3 April 2014. When SPHY is run in an operational setting, this spatial information can be
included in a decision support system that aids the farmer in irrigation planning for the coming
days.</p>

</div>
<p>Since this study was a demonstration project, only an initial model calibration was performed.
The model was in this case most sensitive for the crop coefficient (Kc), affecting the evaporative
demand for water. As can be seen in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-romania-soil-moisture-calibration"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 5</span></a>, the temporal patterns as measured by the soil
moisture sensor are well simulated by the SPHY model. Based on daily soil moisture values, a
Nash–Sutcliffe <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#nash1970" id="id8">[31]</a> model efficiency coefficient of 0.6 was found,
indicating that the quality of prediction of the SPHY model is “good” <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#foglia2009" id="id9">[7]</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Soil moisture simulations could be further improved by conducting a full model calibration, adjusting
the soil physical parameters. Remotely sensed sensed evapotranspiration can be used in the
calibration process <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#immerzeel2008" id="id10">[13]</a>, although such data are often not available on
these small scales as ET is a very complex variable to assess <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#samain2012" id="id11">[33]</a>. It should also
be noted that soil moisture content is typically highly variable in space; a very high correlation
between point measurements and gridcell simulations of soil moisture may therefore not always be
feasible <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#bramer2013" id="id12">[3]</a>.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#id13" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>SPHY is being used in large Asian river basins with significant contribution of glacier melt and
snowmelt to the total flow (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#immerzeel2012a" id="id14">[15]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lutz2012a" id="id15">[24]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lutz2014" id="id16">[27]</a>). The major goals of
these applications are two-fold:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Assess the current hydrological regimes at high resolution; e.g., assess spatial
differences in the contributions of glacier melt, snowmelt and rainfall–runoff to the total
flow.</li>
<li>Quantify the effects of climate change on the hydrological regimes in the future and how
these affect the water availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rivers originating in the high mountains of Asia are considered to be the most meltwater
dependent river systems on Earth <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#schaner2012a" id="id17">[34]</a>. In the regions surrounding
the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau large human populations depend on the water
supplied by these rivers <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#immerzeel-2010a" id="id18">[16]</a>. However, the dependency on melt water
differs strongly between river basins as a result of differences in climate and differences
in basin hypsometry <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#immerzeel2012" id="id19">[12]</a>. Only by using a distributed
hydrological modelling approach that includes the simulation of key hydrological and
cryospheric processes, and inclusion of transient changes in climate, snow cover,
glaciers and runoff, appropriate adaptation and mitigation options can be developed for
this region <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#sorg2012" id="id20">[36]</a>. The SPHY model is very suitable for such goals, and has
therefore been widely applied in the region.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id21">
<h3>Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#id21" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the Himalayan Climate Change Adaptation Programme (HICAP), led by the International Centre
for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), SPHY has been successfully applied in the upstreambasins of the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Salween
and Mekong rivers (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lutz2013" id="id22">[25]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lutz2014" id="id23">[27]</a>).</p>
<p>For application in this region, SPHY was setup at a 1 km spatial resolution using a daily
time-step, and forced with historical air temperature (Tavg, Tmax, Tmin) and precipitation
data, obtained from global and regional datasets (e.g. APHRODITE <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#yatagai2012a" id="id24">[43]</a>,
Princeton <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#sheffield2006a" id="id25">[35]</a>, TRMM <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#gopalan2010" id="id26">[9]</a>) or interpolated WMO
station data froma historical reference period. For this historical reference period SPHY
was calibrated andvalidated using observed streamflow. For the future period, SPHY was
forced with downscaled climate change projections obtained from General Circulation
Models (GCMs), as available through the Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (e.g.
CMIP3 <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#meehl2007a" id="id27">[28]</a>, CMIP5 <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#taylor2012" id="id28">[37]</a>), which were used as basis for the
Assessment Reports prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

We used one parameter set for the entire domain, which inherently means
some stations perform better than others. In the particular case of the upper Indus,
another possible explanation could be uncertainty in air temperature forcing in the
highest parts of the upper Indus basin (locations Dainyor bridge, Besham Qila and
Tarbela inflow in <a class="reference internal" href="#table-station-calibration-hicap"><span class="std std-numref">Table 1</span></a>), since especially in this area, the used forcing datasets are

<p>For basins with snow melt being an important contributor to the flow, besides calibration
to observed flow, the snow-related parameters in the SPHY model can also be calibrated
to observed snow cover. For the Upper Indus basin the snow-related parameters
degree-day factor for snow (DDF) and snow water storage capacity (SSC) were calibrated
independently using MODIS snow cover imagery <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#lutz2014b" id="id35">[26]</a>. The same
MODIS dataset was used as in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#immerzeel2009" id="id36">[14]</a>. From the beginning of 2000 until
halfway 2008, the snow cover imagery was averaged for 46 different periods of 8 days (5
days for the last period) to generate 46 different average snow cover maps. E.g. period 1
is the average snowcover for 1-8 January for 2000 until 2008, whereas period 2 is the average
snow cover for 9-16 January for 2000 until 2008, etc.</p>

</div>
<p>The SPHY model was run for 2000-2007 at a daily time step and for each 1 x 1 km grid cell the average snow cover was
calculated for the same 46 periods as in the MODIS observed snow cover dataset. Subsequently,
these simulated snowcover maps were resampled to 0.05 degrees spatial resolution, which is the
native resolution of the MODIS product.</p>

grid cell level. As a final step, the baseflow recession coefficient and routing coefficient (kx)
were calibrated to match the simulated streamflow with the observed streamflow.</p>
