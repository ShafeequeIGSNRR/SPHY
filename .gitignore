>>>>>>> 0c0afc4 Added glacier table layout Excel file for testing and designing new functionalities related to sub-gridded glacier and snow fractions layout of glacier table Glacier module updated up till Glacier runoff moved DBmask and CImask to initial section as self.DBmask and self.CImask corrected FRAC_GLAC calculation Improved glacier module implemented up till the reporting part Updated glacier module. Next step is to define matrix with variables to report for glacier ID output. Glacier module is working. Code cleanup may be needed for line 760-933 to put this part in a separate glacier.py Fixed a bug that resulted in a wrong connection between glacier cells and model id cells. There was still a bug in the allocation of the correct MODEL ID where glaciers are present to the location within the model grid. This was due to the layout of the glactable, which was not sorted based on the MOD_ID. This has now been fixed. Fixed bug in calculation/reporting of monthly glacier balance. For the storage it took the overall average, but it should be the last day's storage. For the fluxes the totals where averaged over the number of years. This is modified to calculate the totals instead of monthly averages. Removed uncessary map reading (debris map and glacier id map) from config and sphy.py file Updated dynamic glacier retreat up till reporting of updated glacier fraction Updated dynamic retreat with ice depths and fractions being updated. As long as ice depths > 0, then glacier fraction remains unchanged. Both annual glacier fraction and ice depth maps are reported. Commit on 21-09-2016 before changing the way the glacier balance is reported. Updated reporting Commit on 23-09-2016 Implemented Tlapse rates per month and fixed some bugs Removed some print statements and cleaning up of code Updated config with correct path settings. Removed the self.iceDepth_Table and self.Frac_table for reporting, and integrated this into the reporting of the variables. Therefore these need to be added to the list of reported glacier variables in the config file. Delete SPHY_mass_conserving_glaciers_WI.docx Included the dynamic glacier module component in the calculation of the water balance
